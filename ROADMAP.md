# nape-js — Roadmap

## Completed Items

Done: P21-P28, P30-P33, P35, P37-P43, P44, P45-P48, P50-P57, P60, P62, P63, P64, P66-P68, P69, P70, P71.
Done (partial): P65 — platformer template + `/templates` page shipped; the `create-nape-game` CLI is implemented but **on hold** (kept private, not published) until adoption signal justifies the maintenance surface.
Cancelled: P34 (tree shaking — architectural limit), P36 (server demos — superseded by P52), P49 (ECS adapter — trivial pattern).

## Strategy

The engine is feature-rich (~50 demos, fluid sim, replay, character controller,
helpers — beyond what the leading JS competitors ship). External adoption
signal is still weak: 0 issues / PRs from non-maintainers, ~3 trivial public
references via GitHub code search. The npm download counter is dominated by
CI / mirrors / scanners, not real users.

→ The next investments are weighted toward **discoverability and onboarding
friction**, not feature depth. Demo-front growth is paused — the demo grid is
already saturated.

## Active Priorities

| #   | Priority                  | Effort | Impact          | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --- | ------------------------- | ------ | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P75 | **More game templates**   | M      | :fire: adoption | Follow-ups to the platformer: top-down car, pinball, ragdoll fighter, top-down shooter. Each adds another card on `/templates`. **Follow-up:** re-surface the `Templates` tab on the homepage (currently removed — only one starter justified hiding it) and decide whether to revive `create-nape-game` (currently `private: true`, parked) once template count grows |
| P72 | **`convexCast` demo**     | S      | docs            | `Space.convexCast` / `convexMultiCast` is public API but invisible in the demo grid. A swept-shape hit-prediction demo (e.g. swung sword) makes it discoverable           |
| P61 | **Bundle size reduction** | S-M    | competitiveness | 123 KB vs Phaser Box2D 65 KB, gap is widening (+~36 KB from recent helpers). Real adoption blocker. Dead-code audit, hot-path review, helper opt-in re-export plan        |
| P58 | **Phaser plugin/adapter** | M      | :fire: adoption | #1 JS game framework. Worth doing now that the platformer template is live — adapters need a working onboarding story to demo against                                     |
| P59 | **React/R3F integration** | M      | adoption        | `@react-three/rapier`-style package for the React gamedev community. After P58                                                                                            |
| P29 | Test coverage → 80%       | L      | safety          | :diamonds: ~72% statements (5684 tests). Background work, not blocking anything                                                                                           |

## Long-Tail / Speculative

Not blocking anything; revisit only when a concrete user request justifies the cost.

| #   | Priority                          | Effort | Why deferred                                                                                                                                                            |
| --- | --------------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P73 | Replay delta encoding             | M      | Snapshot keyframes are ~150–300 B/body. No one has reported the size as a pain point. Worth ~5–10× shrink, but the demand is hypothetical                               |
| P74 | Cross-platform deterministic math | L      | Same-platform determinism already works. Fixed-point hot path (Q32.32) is only needed for true P2P rollback netcode — no concrete user case yet, large engine-wide cost |

---

## Recommended Execution Order

1. **P75** — More game templates (top-down car, pinball, ragdoll fighter); reuses the platformer pipeline (the CLI stays parked until template count or user demand justifies it)
2. **P72** — `convexCast` demo (small, ships the visibility win quickly)
3. **P61** — Bundle size reduction
4. **P58** — Phaser plugin/adapter
5. **P59** — React/R3F integration
6. **P29** — Continue test coverage push toward 80% (background)
7. (Defer **P73** and **P74** until a concrete user request appears)
