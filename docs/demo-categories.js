/**
 * Demo category map — splits the demo grid into two top-level buckets.

 *   serialization, determinism, soft body, debug rendering, etc.).
 * - "game"    — playable mini-games or gameplay slices that *use* the engine
 *   (platformer, shooter, MOBA, tower defense, slingshot, pinball, …).
 *
 * Demos default to "physics" if not listed.
